I believe I originally made this game around 2014. It features a character in a maze. You can move in the cardinal directions.

Be sure to try the level editor!

My inspiration was the movement and basic overworld puzzles in the older Pokemon games (for instance silph co in red/blue).

It has bolders, ice, direction-changing ice (you take a 90Â° turn while sliding), and buttons which unlock barriers.
