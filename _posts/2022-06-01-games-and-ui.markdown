I bought the domain `cwynn.com` in early 2008 from godaddy. Over time I've switched hosts a number of times. I currently live in gh-pages (i.e. hosted for free). But older pages with server-side functionalities have all broken.

In an attempt to at least save some of these projects off I spent some time moving things to github. Part of this involved updating the layout and content of this site.

The biggest change is splitting up everything into "tags"

[Featured]({% link _pages/all.markdown %}) contains posts I want to show up on the home page. In theory I'll change these once in a while.

[Games]({% link _pages/games.markdown %}) all webgames which are playable online I'd like to have in here.
