# Hi!

My name is Charlie Wynn. This is where I put things I'm interested in.

# A little about me...

I'm in my mid-30s. Married.
I work remotely as a software developer.

I enjoy disc golf, rock climbing, philosophy, yoga, lock picking, tools and fixing things, personal finance, motorcycle-riding, reading, home improvement...

# What is on here?

Little web games I've made over the last ~15 years. I'm not very serious about web development. But it's a nice way to get your content to more people.

Projects around the house. Various problems I've come across and how I fixed them.

Some of my projects I strive to do "right". Some I strive to do quickly. Some I just want to play around with an idea.

# Where/How is this site hosted?

This is a jekyll blog hosted on github pages.
The hosting is free this way. Any server-side tasks I run are in AWS with an api-gateway from this site to do various things (really not much).  
I have some custom layouts (why there isn't a "posts" homepage). Since this isn't a "product" I haven't worked very hard to make it "perfect".
